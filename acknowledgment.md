### Thanks to:

* CAPE was originally developed at Context Information Security so a huge thanks to Mark Raeburn and everyone else at ContextIS for giving life to this project.
* A massive thank you to doomedraven (@D00m3dR4v3n) for porting CAPE to Python 3 and for his huge contributions and tireless support.
* CAPE is derived from spender-sandbox (https://github.com/spender-sandbox), which is derived from Cuckoo Sandbox (https://github.com/cuckoosandbox), so thanks to Brad Spengler, Claudio Guarnieri, Jurriaan Bremer and the countless other Cuckoo contributors without whom this work would not be possible.
