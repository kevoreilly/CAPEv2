```
cd /opt/CAPEv2/data/

git clone https://github.com/x0r19x91/UnAutoIt && cd UnAutoIt
GOOS="linux" GOARCH="amd64" go build -o UnAutoIt

sudo dpkg -i DIE.deb
```

### [18-02-2022] Depricate static

* Make standard file key for all `path` keys. No more: `file`, `path`, etc. Now just `x["path"]`
* MWCP, malwareconfigs, and malduck are not part of requirements.txt anymore! They bring their own dependencies that not everyone needs. If you enable that framework in processing.conf you need to install that dependencies.
    * TIP: You need to figurate the proper version(is another reason why we abondone them)
        * `pip3 install git+https://github.com/Defense-Cyber-Crime-Center/DC3-MWCP`

        * `x64` VMs should have both `x64` and `x86` tags. Otherwise only `x64` tag
    * `x86` VMs should have only `x86` tag.
    * You can use any other tags, just to work properly you need those two.
    * Tags requires update in `machine` table in distributed database if your server contains only x64 VMs.
    * Probably will be improved in future for better solution
* __ACTION REQUIRED__
    * `cd /opt/CAPEv2/utils/db_migration && alembic upgrade head`
