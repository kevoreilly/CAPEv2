Signatures
==========

By taking advantage of CAPE's customizability, you can write signatures which will then
by run against analysis results. These signatures can be used to identify a predefined
pattern that represents a malicious behavior or an indicator that you're interested in.

These signatures are very useful to give context to the analyses. They
simplify the interpretation of the results and assist with automatically identifying
malware samples of interest.

A few examples of what you can use CAPE's signatures for are:
    * Identify a particular malware family that you're interested in, by isolating unique behaviors (like file names or mutexes).
    * Spot interesting modifications that the malware performs on the system, such as the installation of device drivers.
    * Identify particular malware categories, such as Banking Trojans or Ransomware, by isolating typical actions that are commonly performed by these categories.

You can find signatures created by the CAPE administrators and other CAPE users on the `Community`_ repository.

Getting Started
===============

Creating a signature is a very simple process but requires a decent
understanding of Python programming.

First things first, all signatures must be located inside the *modules/signatures/* directory.

The following is a basic example signature:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class CreatesExe(Signature):
            name = "creates_exe"
            description = "Creates a Windows executable on the filesystem"
            severity = 2
            categories = ["generic"]
            authors = ["CAPE Developers"]
            minimum = "0.5"

            def run(self):
                return self.check_file(pattern=".*\\.exe$",
                                       regex=True)

As you can see the structure of the signature is really simple and consistent with the other CAPE
modules. Note that on line **12** a helper function is used. These helper functions
assist with signature-writing and we highly recommend becoming familiar with what helper functions are
available to you (found in the
[Signature class](https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2/blob/master/lib/cuckoo/common/abstracts.py))
before you start writing signatures. Some documentation for :ref:`Helpers` can be found below.

In the example above, the helper function is used to walk through all of the accessed files in the summary and check
if there are any files ending with "*.exe*". If there is at least one, then the helper function will return ``True``;
 otherwise it will return ``False``. When a signature returns True, that means that the signature matched.

If the signature matches, a new entry in the "signatures" section will be added to
the **global container** `self.results` as follows::

    "signatures": [
        {
            "severity": 2,
            "description": "Creates a Windows executable on the filesystem",
            "alert": false,
            "references": [],
            "data": [
                {
                    "file_name": "C:\\d.exe"
                }
            ],
            "name": "creates_exe"
        }
    ]

We could rewrite the exact same signature by accessing the **global container**
directly, rather than through the helper function `check_file`:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class CreatesExe(Signature):
            name = "creates_exe"
            description = "Creates a Windows executable on the filesystem"
            severity = 2
            categories = ["generic"]
            authors = ["Cuckoo Developers"]
            minimum = "0.5"

            def run(self):
                for file_path in self.results["behavior"]["summary"]["files"]:
                    if file_path.endswith(".exe"):
                        return True

                return False

If you access the **global container** directly, you must know its structure,
which can be observed in the JSON report of your analyses.

Creating your new signature
===========================

To help you better understand the process of creating a signature, we
are going to create a very simple one together and walk through the steps and
the available options. For this purpose, we're going to create a
signature that checks whether the malware analyzed opens a mutex named
"i_am_a_malware".

The first thing to do is to import the dependencies, create a skeleton, and define
some initial attributes. These are the attributes that you can currently set:

    * ``name``: an identifier for the signature.
    * ``description``: a brief description of what the signature represents.
    * ``severity``: a number identifying the severity of the events matched (generally between 1 and 3).
    * ``confidence``: a number between 1 and 100 that represents how confident the signature writer is that this signature will not be raised as a false positive.
    * ``weight``: a number used for calculating the `malscore` of a submission. This attribute acts as a multiplier of the product of severity and confidence.
    * ``categories``: a list of categories that describe the type of event being matched (for example "*banker*", "*injection*" or "*anti-vm*"). For a list of all categories, see :ref:`Categories`.
    * ``families``: a list of malware family names, in case the signature specifically matches a known one.
    * ``authors``: a list of people who authored the signature.
    * ``references``: a list of references (URLs) to give context to the signature.
    * ``enabled``: if set to False the signature will be skipped.
    * ``alert``: if set to True can be used to specify that the signature should be reported (perhaps by a dedicated reporting module).
    * ``minimum``: the minimum required version of CAPE to successfully run this signature.
    * ``maximum``: the maximum required version of CAPE to successfully run this signature.
    * ``ttps``: a list of MITRE ATT&CK IDs applicable to this signature.
    * ``mbcs``: a list of MITRE Malware Behavior Catalog IDs applicable to this signature.

In our example, we will create the following skeleton:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class BadBadMalware(Signature): # We initialize the class by inheriting Signature.
            name = "badbadmalware" # We define the name of the signature
            description = "Creates a mutex known to be associated with Win32.BadBadMalware" # We provide a description
            severity = 3 # We set the severity to maximum
            categories = ["trojan"] # We add a category
            families = ["badbadmalware"] # We add the name of our fictional malware family
            authors = ["Me"] # We specify the author
            minimum = "0.5" # We specify that in order to run the signature, the user will need at least CAPE 0.5

        def run(self):
            return

This is a perfectly valid signature. It doesn't do anything yet,
so now we need to define the conditions for the signature to be matched.

Since we want to match a particular mutex name, we use the helper function `check_mutex`:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class BadBadMalware(Signature):
            name = "badbadmalware"
            description = "Creates a mutex known to be associated with Win32.BadBadMalware"
            severity = 3
            categories = ["trojan"]
            families = ["badbadmalware"]
            authors = ["Me"]
            minimum = "0.5"

        def run(self):
            return self.check_mutex("i_am_a_malware")

It's as simple as that! Now our signature will return ``True`` if the analyzed
malware was observed opening the specified mutex.

If you want to be more explicit and directly access the **global container**,
you could translate the previous signature in the following way:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class BadBadMalware(Signature):
            name = "badbadmalware"
            description = "Creates a mutex known to be associated with Win32.BadBadMalware"
            severity = 3
            categories = ["trojan"]
            families = ["badbadmalware"]
            authors = ["Me"]
            minimum = "0.5"

        def run(self):
            for mutex in self.results["behavior"]["summary"]["mutexes"]:
                if mutex == "i_am_a_malware":
                    return True

            return False

Evented Signatures
==================

Since version 1.0, CAPE provides a way to write more high-performance signatures.
In the past, every signature was required to loop through the whole collection of API calls
collected during the analysis. This was necessarily causing some performance issues when such
a collection would be large.

CAPE now supports both the old model as well as what we call "evented signatures".
The main difference is that with this new format, all the signatures will be executed in parallel
and a callback function called ``on_call()`` will be invoked for each signature within one
single loop through the collection of API calls.

An example signature using this technique is the following:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from lib.cuckoo.common.abstracts import Signature

        class SystemMetrics(Signature):
            name = "generic_metrics"
            description = "Uses GetSystemMetrics"
            severity = 2
            categories = ["generic"]
            authors = ["CAPE Developers"]
            minimum = "1.0"

            # Evented signatures need to implement the "on_call" method
            evented = True

            # Evented signatures can specify filters that reduce the amount of
            # API calls that are streamed in. One can filter Process name, API
            # name/identifier and category. These should be sets for faster lookup.
            filter_processnames = set()
            filter_apinames = set(["GetSystemMetrics"])
            filter_categories = set()

            # This is a signature template. It should be used as a skeleton for
            # creating custom signatures, therefore is disabled by default.
            # The on_call function is used in "evented" signatures.
            # These use a more efficient way of processing logged API calls.
            enabled = False

            def stop(self):
                # In the stop method one can implement any cleanup code and
                #  decide one last time if this signature matches or not.
                #  Return True in case it matches.
                return False

            # This method will be called for every logged API call by the loop
            # in the RunSignatures plugin. The return value determines the "state"
            # of this signature. True means the signature matched and False means
            # it can't match anymore. Both of which stop streaming in API calls.
            # Returning None keeps the signature active and will continue.
            def on_call(self, call, process):
                # This check would in reality not be needed as we already make use
                # of filter_apinames above.
                if call["api"] == "GetSystemMetrics":
                    # Signature matched, return True.
                    return True

                # continue
                return None

The inline comments are already self-explanatory.

Matches
=======

Starting from version 1.2, signatures can log exactly what triggered
the signature. This allows users to better understand why this signature is
present in the log, and to be able to better focus malware analysis.

Two helpers have been included to specify matching data.

.. function:: Signature.add_match(process, type, match)

    Adds a match to the signature. Can be called several times for the same signature.

    :param process: process dictionary (same as the ``on_call`` argument). Should be ``None`` except when used in evented signatures.
    :type process: dict
    :param type: nature of the matching data. Can be anything (ex: ``'file'``, ``'registry'``, etc.). If match is composed of api calls (when used in evented signatures), should be ``'api'``.
    :type type: string
    :param match: matching data. Can be a single element or a list of elements. An element can be a string, a dict or an API call (when used in evented signatures).

    Example Usage, with a single element:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        self.add_match(None, "url", "http://malicious_url_detected.com")

    Example Usage, with a more complex signature, needing several API calls to be triggered:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        self.signs = []
        self.signs.append(first_api_call)
        self.signs.append(second_api_call)
        self.add_match(process, 'api', self.signs)

.. function:: Signature.has_matches()

    Checks whether the current signature has any matching data registered. Returns ``True`` in case it does, otherwise returns ``False``.

    This can be used to easily add several matches for the same signature. If you want to do so, make sure that all the api calls are scanned by making sure that ``on_call`` never returns ``True``. Then, use ``on_complete`` with ``has_matches`` so that the signature is triggered if any match was previously added.

    :rtype: boolean

    Example Usage, from the `network_tor` signature:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        def on_call(self, call, process):
            if self.check_argument_call(call,
                                        pattern="Tor Win32 Service",
                                        api="CreateServiceA",
                                        category="services"):
                self.add_match(process, "api", call)

        def on_complete(self):
            return self.has_matches()

.. _Helpers:
