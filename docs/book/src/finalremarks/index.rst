Asking for help
===================

Please read the following rules before posting:

 * Before posting, Google about your issue. **DO NOT** post questions that
   have already been answered over and over everywhere.
 * Posting messages saying just something like "Doesn't work, help me" are completely
   useless. If something is not working report the error, paste the logs,
   the config file, the information on the virtual machine, the
   results of the troubleshooting, etc. Give context. We are not wizards and we
   don't have a crystal ball.
 * Use a proper title. Stuff like "Doesn't work", "Help me", "Error" are not
   proper titles.
 * Try to use `pastebin.com`_, `pastie.org`_ or similar services to paste
   logs and configs: makes the message more readable.
 * **Github issues**. Please read the `Markdown`_
   documentation before posting, how to escape and post configs as code block.
