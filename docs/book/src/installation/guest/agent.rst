Installing the Agent
====================

This agent is designed to be cross-platform, therefore you should be able
to use it on Windows as well as on Linux and OS X.
To make CAPE work properly, you'll have to install and start this agent.

It's very simple.

In the *agent/* directory you will find an *agent.py* file, just copy it
to the Guest operating system (in whatever way you want, perhaps in a temporary
shared folder or by downloading it from a Host webserver) and run it.
This will launch the HTTP server which will be listening for connections.

On Windows simply launching the script will also spawn a Python window, if
you want to hide it you can rename the file from *agent.py* to **agent.pyw**
which will prevent the window from spawning.

If you want the script to be launched at Windows' boot, place the file in 
the admin startup folder. To access it, open the app launcher with **Win+R** 
and search for "shell:common startup" which will open the folder you want 
(usually ``C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp``). 
Do not place the agent in the user startup folder (usually 
``C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup``) 
as it will launch the agent without admin privileges and therefore insufficient 
permissions resulting in it not working as intended. Just place the file in the 
admin startup folder, add it to autorun service, etc see how malware does it 
for tricks ;).
