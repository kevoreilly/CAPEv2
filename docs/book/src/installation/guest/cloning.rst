Cloning the Virtual Machine
===========================

If you want to use more than one virtual machine based on a single "golden image", there's no need to
repeat all the steps done so far: you can clone it. This way you'll have
a copy of the original virtualized Windows with all requirements already
installed.

There is a `Python command-line utility`_ available that can automate this process for you.

The new virtual machine will also contain all of the settings of the original one,
which is not good. Now you need to proceed by repeating the steps explained in
:doc:`network`, :doc:`agent`, and :doc:`saving` for this new machine.
