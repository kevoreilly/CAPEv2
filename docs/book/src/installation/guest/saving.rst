Saving the Virtual Machine
==========================

Now you should be ready to save the virtual machine to a snapshot state.

Before doing this, **make sure that you have rebooted the guest softly and that it's currently
running, with CAPE's agent running and with Windows fully booted**.

Now you can proceed with saving the machine, which depends on
the virtualization software that you decided to use.

The virtualization software-specific instructions found below can assist with getting the virtual
machine ready to be used by CAPE.

KVM
===

Here are some helpful links for creating a virtual machine with ``virt-manager``:

    * `Advanced KVM preparation for malware analysis`_

If you have decided to adopt KVM, you must use a disk format for
your virtual machines that supports snapshots.
By default, ``libvirt`` tools create RAW virtual disks, and since we need snapshots
you'll have to use either QCOW2 or LVM. For the scope of this guide, we adopt QCOW2,
since it is easier to set up than LVM.

The easiest way to create such a virtual disk is by using the tools
provided by the ``libvirt`` suite. You can either use ``virsh`` if you prefer
command-line interfaces or ``virt-manager`` for a nice GUI.
You should be able to directly create the virtual disk in the QCOW2 format, but in case you have
a RAW disk you can convert it like this::

    $ cd /your/disk/image/path
    $ qemu-img convert -O qcow2 your_disk.raw your_disk.qcow2

Now edit your VM definition as follows::

    $ virsh edit "<Name of VM>"

Find the disk section, which looks like this::

    <disk type='file' device='disk'>
        <driver name='qemu' type='raw'/>
        <source file='/your/disk/image/path/your_disk.raw'/>
        <target dev='hda' bus='ide'/>
        <address type='drive' controller='0' bus='0' unit='0'/>
    </disk>

And change "type" to qcow2 and "source file" to your qcow2 disk image path, like this::

    <disk type='file' device='disk'>
        <driver name='qemu' type='qcow2'/>
        <source file='/your/disk/image/path/your_disk.qcow2'/>
        <target dev='hda' bus='ide'/>
        <address type='drive' controller='0' bus='0' unit='0'/>
    </disk>

KVM by default will pass through a feature flag, viewable in ECX as the 31st bit
after executing the CPUID instruction with EAX set to 1. Some malware will use this
unprivileged instruction to detect its execution in a VM. One way to avoid this is to modify
your VM definition as follows:  find the following line::

	<domain type='kvm'>

Change it to::

	  <domain type='kvm' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'>

Then within the domain element, add the following::

    <qemu:commandline>
      <qemu:arg value='-cpu'/>
      <qemu:arg value='host,-hypervisor'/>
    </qemu:commandline>

Instead of using "host", you can also choose from multiple other CPU models from the
list displayed with the ``qemu-system-i386 -cpu help`` command (SandyBridge, Haswell, etc).

Now test your virtual machine. If everything works, prepare it for snapshotting while
running CAPE's agent. This means the virtual machine needs to be running
when you take the snapshot.
You can take a snapshot with the following command via ``virsh``::

    $ virsh snapshot-create "<Name of VM>"
    $ virsh snapshot-create-as --domain "<Name of VM>" --name "<Name of snapshot>"

After snapshotting the guest, you can shut it down.

    .. warning::
        Having multiple snapshots can cause errors such as:

        ``ERROR: No snapshot found for virtual machine <VM-Name>``

        VM snapshots can be managed using the following commands.

            $ virsh snapshot-list "<VM-Name>"

            $ virsh snapshot-delete "<VM-Name>" "<Snapshot-Name>""

VirtualBox
==========

If you are going for VirtualBox you can take the snapshot from the graphical user
interface or the command line::

    $ VBoxManage snapshot "<Name of VM>" take "<Name of snapshot>" --pause

After the snapshot creation is completed, you can power off the machine and
restore it::

    $ VBoxManage controlvm "<Name of VM>" poweroff
    $ VBoxManage snapshot "<Name of VM>" restorecurrent

VMware Workstation
==================

If you decided to adopt VMware Workstation, you can take the snapshot from the graphical user
interface or the command line::

    $ vmrun snapshot "/your/disk/image/path/wmware_image_name.vmx" your_snapshot_name

Where your_snapshot_name is the name you choose for the snapshot.
After that power off the machine from the GUI or the command line::

    $ vmrun stop "/your/disk/image/path/wmware_image_name.vmx" hard

XenServer
=========

If you decided to adopt XenServer, the XenServer machinery supports starting
virtual machines from either disk or a memory snapshot. Creating and reverting
memory snapshots require that the Xen guest tools be installed in the
virtual machine. The recommended method of booting XenServer virtual machines is
through memory snapshots because they can greatly reduce the boot time of
virtual machines during analysis. If, however, the option of installing the
guest tools is not available, the virtual machine can be configured to have its
disks reset on boot. Resetting the disk ensures that malware samples cannot
permanently modify the virtual machine.

Memory Snapshots
----------------

The Xen guest tools can be installed from the XenCenter application that ships
with XenServer. Once installed, restart the virtual machine and ensure that the
CAPE agent is running.

Snapshots can be taken through the XenCenter application and the command line
interface on the control domain (Dom0). When creating the snapshot from
XenCenter, ensure that the "Snapshot disk and memory" is checked. Once created,
right-click on the snapshot and note the snapshot UUID.

To snapshot from the command line interface, run the following command::

    $ xe vm-checkpoint vm="vm_uuid_or_name" new-name-label="Snapshot Name/Description"

The snapshot UUID is printed to the screen once the command completes.

Regardless of how the snapshot was created, save the UUID in the virtual
machine's configuration section. Once the snapshot has been created, you can
shut down the virtual machine.

Booting from Disk
-----------------

If you can't install the Xen guest tools or if you don't need to use memory
snapshots, you will need to ensure that the virtual machine's disks are reset on
boot and that the CAPE agent is set to run at boot time.

Running the agent at boot time can be configured in Windows by adding a startup
item for the agent.

The following commands must be run while the virtual machine is powered off.

To set the virtual machine's disks to reset on boot, you'll first need to list
all the attached disks for the virtual machine. To list all attached disks, run
the following command::

    $ xe vm-disk-list vm="vm_name_or_uuid"

Ignoring all CD-ROM and read-only disks, run the following command for each
remaining disk to change its behavior to reset on boot::

    $ xe vdi-param-set uuid="vdi_uuid" on-boot=reset

After the disk is set to reset on boot, no permanent changes can be made to the
virtual machine's disk. Modifications that occur while a virtual machine is
running will not persist past shutdown.

Azure
=====
Once you have a virtual machine that is ready to be your golden image for a 
virtual machine scale set, take a snapshot of the virtual machine's disk.

Official documentation on how to do this: `Create a snapshot of a virtual hard disk <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/snapshot-copy-managed-disk?tabs=portal>`_

We are now going to turn this snapshot into an "image", which is the terminology 
Azure uses as the base for all virtual machines in a scale set. 

1. Create a Compute Gallery resource.
    a. `Create a gallery for storing and sharing resources <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/create-gallery?tabs=portal%2Ccli2>`_
2. Create an Image Definition in this Compute Gallery.
    a. `Create an image definition and an image version <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/image-version?tabs=portal>`_
    b. Operating System state must be SPECIALIZED
    c. Create an Image Version, and select "Disks and/or snapshots" as the Source.
    d. Select the snapshot of the golden image.

The creation of an image from a snapshot takes a while, so be patient.

In the ``az.conf`` file, you will need to specify the Compute Gallery Name as well as 
the Image Definition Name.
