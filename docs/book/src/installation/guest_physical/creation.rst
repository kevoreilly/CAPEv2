Creation of the Physical Machine
================================

Once you have :doc:`properly installed <../host/requirements>` your imaging
software, you can proceed on creating all the physical machines you need.

Using and configuring your imaging software is out of the scope of this
guide, so please refer to the official documentation.

    .. note::

        You can find some hints and considerations on how to design and create
        your virtualized environment in the :doc:`../../introduction/sandboxing`
        chapter.

    .. note::
        For analysis purposes you are recommended to use Windows 7 with User
        Access Control disabled.


When creating the physical machine, CAPE doesn't require any specific
configuration. You can choose the options that best fit your needs.
