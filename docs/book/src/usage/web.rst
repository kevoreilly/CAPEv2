=============
Web interface
=============

CAPE provides a full-fledged web interface in the form of a Django application.
This interface will allow you to submit files, browse through the reports as well
as search across all the analysis results.

``cape2.sh`` adds ``systemd`` daemon called ``cape-web.service`` which listen on all interfaces::

    $ /lib/systemd/system/cape-web.service

To modify that you need to edit that file and change from ``0.0.0.0`` to your IP.
You need to restart daemon to reload after change it::

    $ systemctl daemon-reload

If you get migration-related WARNINGS when launching the cape-web service, you should execute::

    $ poetry run python3 manage.py migrate

.. note:: In order to improve performance, it is recommended to move from SQLite to PostgreSQL.

Configuration
=============

The web interface pulls data from a Mongo database or ElasticSearch, so having
either the MongoDB or ElasticSearchDB reporting modules enabled in ``reporting.conf``
is mandatory for this interface. If that's not the case, the application won't start
and it will raise an exception. Also, currently, Django only supports having one of
the database modules enabled at a time.

Enable web interface auth
-------------------------
To enable web authentication you need to edit `conf/web.conf` -> `web_auth` -> `enabled = yes`,
after that you need to create your django admin user by running following command from `web` folder::

    $ poetry run python manage.py createsuperuser

For more security tips see `Exposed to internet`_ section.


Enable/Disable REST API Endpoints
---------------------------------
By default, there are multiple REST API endpoints that are disabled.
To enable them, head to the `API configuration file`_

For example, to enable the `machines/list` endpoint, you must find the `[machinelist]`
header in the configuration file just mentioned and set the `enabled` field to `yes`.

Restart the CAPE web service for the changes to take effect::

    $ systemctl restart cape-web

.. _`API configuration file`: https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2/blob/master/conf/api.conf


Usage
=====

To start the web interface, you can simply run the following command
from the ``web/`` directory::

    $ python3 manage.py runserver_plus --traceback --keep-meta-shutdown

If you want to configure the web interface as listening for any IP on a
specified port (by default the web interface is deployed at localhost:8000), you can start it with the following command (replace PORT
with the desired port number)::

    $ python3 manage.py runserver_plus 0.0.0.0:8000 --traceback --keep-meta-shutdown

You can serve CAPE's web interface using WSGI interface with common web servers:
Apache, Nginx, Unicorn, and so on. Devs are using Nginx + Uwsgi.
Please refer both to the documentation of the web server of your choice as well as `Django documentation`_.

.. _`Django documentation`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/


Subscription
============

Subscription allows you to control which users what can do what.

Right now we support:

    * Request - Limits per second/minute/hour using django-ratelimit extensions
    * Reports - Allow or block downloading reports for specific users. Check conf/web.conf to enable this feature.

To extend the capabilities of control what users can do check `Django migrations a primer`_.

.. _`Django migrations a primer`: https://realpython.com/django-migrations-a-primer/

In few works you need to add new fields to ``models.py`` and run ``python3 manage.py makemigrations``


Exposed to internet
===================

To get rid of many bots/scrappers so we suggest deploying this amazing project `Nginx Ultimate bad bot blocker`_, follow the README for installation steps

* Enable web auth with captcha in `conf/web.conf` properly to avoid any brute force.
* Enable `ReCaptcha`_. You will need to set ``Public`` and ``Secret`` keys in ``web/web/settings.py``
* You might need to "Verify" and set as "Stuff user" to your admin in the Django admin panel and add your domain to Sites in Django admin too
* `AllAuth`_ aka SSO authentication with Google, Github, etc. `Video Tutorial`_ & `StackOverflow Example`_:
    * Note ``SITE_ID=1`` in django admin is ``example.com`` rename it to your domain to get it working

Best practices for production
=============================

Gunicorn + NGINX is the recommended way of serving the CAPE web UI.

First, configure the ``cape-web`` service to use Gunicorn

Modify ``/lib/systemd/system/cape-web.service`` so the ``ExecStart``
setting is set to
``/usr/bin/python3 -m poetry run gunicorn web.wsgi -w 4 -t 200 --capture-output --enable-stdio-inheritance``.

Run

.. code:: bash

   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo service cape-web restart

Next, install NGINX and configure it to be a reverse proxy to Gunicorn.

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install nginx

Create a configuration file at ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/cape``

Replace ``www.capesandbox.com`` with your actual hostname.

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name www.capesandbox.com;
        client_max_body_size 101M;
        proxy_connect_timeout 75;
        proxy_send_timeout 200;
        proxy_read_timeout 200;


        location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
          default_type "text/plain";
          root         /var/www/html;
          break;
      }

      location = /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        return 404;
      }

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Remote-User $remote_user;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }

        location /static/ {
            alias /opt/CAPEv2/web/static/;
        }

        location /static/admin/ {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Remote-User $remote_user;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }

        location /guac {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8008;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_buffering off;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
        }

        location /recordings/playback/recfile {
            alias /opt/CAPEv2/storage/guacrecordings/;
            autoindex off;
        }
    }

If you want to block users from changing their own email addresses, add the following `location` directive inside of the `server` directive:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location /accounts/email/ {
        return 403;
    }

If you want to block users from changing their own passwords, add the following `location` directive inside of the `server` directive:

.. code-block:: nginx

    location /accounts/email/ {
        return 403;
    }

The recording files written by ``guacd`` are only readable by the ``cape`` user and other members of the ``cape`` group, so in order for NGINX to read and serve the recordings the ``www-data`` user must be added to the ``cape`` group.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo usermod www-data -G cape

Then restart NGINX

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo service nginx restart

.. warning::

    The CAPE Guacamole Django web application is currently separate from the main CAPE Django web application, and does not support any authentication. Anyone who can connect to the web server access can Guacamole consoles and recordings, if they know the CAPE analysis ID and Guacamole session GUID.
    
    NGINX can be configured to require HTTP basic authentication for all CAPE web applications, as an alternative to the Django authentication system.

    Install the ``apache2-utils`` package, which contains the ``htpasswd`` utility.
 
    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install apache2-utils

    Use the ``htpasswd`` file to create a new password file and add a first user, such as ``cape``.

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo htpasswd -c /opt/CAPEv2/web/.htpasswd cape

    Use the same command without the `-c` option to add another user to an existing password file.

    Set the proper file permissions.

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo chown root:www-data /opt/CAPEv2/web/.htpasswd
        sudo chmod u=rw,g=r,o= /opt/CAPEv2/web/.htpasswd

    Add the following lines to the NGINX configuration, just below the ``client_max_body_size`` line.

    .. code-block :: nginx

        auth_basic           "Authentication required";
        auth_basic_user_file /opt/CAPEv2/web/.htpasswd;

    Then restart NGINX

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo service nginx restart

Let's Encrypt certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to install a free Let's Encrypt certificate on your NGINX
server, follow these steps, replacing ``capesandbox.com`` with your actual
hostname.

Install `certbot`.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
    sudo snap install --classic certbot
    sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot

Request the certificate

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/html -d www.capesandbox.com -d capesandbox.com
 
Install the certificate. When prompted, select the
"Attempt to reinstall this existing certificate" option.

.. code-block:: bash
 
    sudo certbot --nginx -d www.capesandbox.com -d capesandbox.com

Troubleshooting
===============

Login error: no such column: users_userprofile.reports
------------------------------------------------------

    .. image:: ../_images/screenshots/login_error_user_usersprofile.png
        :align: center

This error usually appears after updating CAPEv2 and one or more changes have been made to the database schema. To solve it, you must use the `web/manage` utility like so::

$ sudo -u cape poetry run python3 manage.py migrate

The output should be similar to::


    $ sudo -u cape poetry run python3 manage.py migrate
    CAPE parser: No module named Nighthawk - No module named 'Crypto'
    Missed dependency flare-floss: poetry run pip install -U flare-floss
    Operations to perform:
      Apply all migrations: account, admin, auth, authtoken, contenttypes, openid, sessions, sites, socialaccount, users
    Running migrations:
      Applying users.0002_reports... OK


After the OK, the web service should be back to normal (no need to restart ``cape-web.service``).

No such table: auth_user
-------------------------

When executing::

$ poetry run python manage.py createsuperuser

an error like ``django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: auth_user``
may be raised. In order to solve it just execute the ``web/manage.py`` utility with the ``migrate`` option::

$ sudo -u cape poetry run python3 web/manage.py migrate
