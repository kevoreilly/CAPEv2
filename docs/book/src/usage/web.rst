=============
Web interface
=============

CAPE provides a full-fledged web interface in the form of a Django application.
This interface will allow you to submit files, browse through the reports as well
as search across all the analysis results.

``cape2.sh`` adds ``systemd`` deamon called ``cape-web.service`` which listen on all interfaces::

    $ /lib/systemd/system/cape-web.service

To modify that you need to edit that file and change from ``0.0.0.0`` to your IP.
You need to restart deamon to reload after change it::

    $ systemctl daemon-reload

If you get migration-related WARNINGS when launching the cape-web service, you should execute::

    $ poetry run python3 manage.py migrate

.. note:: In order to improve performance, it is recommended to move from SQLite to PostgreSQL.

Configuration
=============

The web interface pulls data from a Mongo database or ElasticSearch, so having
either the MongoDB or ElasticSearchDB reporting modules enabled in ``reporting.conf``
is mandatory for this interface. If that's not the case, the application won't start
and it will raise an exception. Also, currently, Django only supports having one of
the database modules enabled at a time.

Enable web interface auth
-------------------------
To enable web authentication you need to edit `conf/web.conf` -> `web_auth` -> `enabled = yes`,
after that you need to create your django admin user by running following command from `web` folder::

    $ poetry run python manage.py createsuperuser

For more security tips see `Exposed to internet`_ section.


Enable/Disable REST API Endpoints
---------------------------------
By default, there are multiple REST API endpoints that are disabled.
To enable them, head to the `API configuration file`_

For example, to enable the `machines/list` endpoint, you must find the `[machinelist]`
header in the configuration file just mentioned and set the `enabled` field to `yes`.

Restart the CAPE web service for the changes to take effect::

    $ systemctl restart cape-web

.. _`API configuration file`: https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2/blob/master/conf/api.conf


Usage
=====

To start the web interface, you can simply run the following command
from the ``web/`` directory::

    $ python3 manage.py runserver_plus --traceback --keep-meta-shutdown

If you want to configure the web interface as listening for any IP on a
specified port (by default the web interace is deployed at localhost:8000), you can start it with the following command (replace PORT
with the desired port number)::

    $ python3 manage.py runserver_plus 0.0.0.0:8000 --traceback --keep-meta-shutdown

You can serve CAPE's web interface using WSGI interface with common web servers:
Apache, Nginx, Unicorn, and so on. Devs are using Nginx + Uwsgi.
Please refer both to the documentation of the web server of your choice as well as `Django documentation`_.

Susciption
==========

Suscription called parts that allows you to control which users what can do.
Right now we support:

    * Request - limitation per second/minute/hours limits using django-ratelimit extensions
    * Reports - Allow or not to download reports to specific user. Check conf/web.conf to enable this feature.

To extend the capabilities of control what users can do check `Django migrations a primer`_.

.. _`Django migrations a primer`: https://realpython.com/django-migrations-a-primer/

In few works you need to add new fields to ``models.py`` and run ``python3 manage.py makemigrations``


Exposed to internet
===================

To get rid of many bots/scrappers so we suggest deploying this amazing project `Nginx Ultimate bad bot blocker`_, follow the README for installation steps

* Enable web auth with captcha in `conf/web.conf` properly to avoid any brute force.
* Enable `ReCaptcha`_. You will need to set ``Public`` and ``Secret`` keys in ``web/web/settings.py``
* You might need to "Verify" and set as "Stuff user" to your admin in the Django admin panel and add your domain to Sites in Django admin too
* `AllAuth`_ aka SSO authentication with Google, Github, etc. `Video Tutorial`_ & `StackOverflow Example`_:
    * Note ``SITE_ID=1`` in django admin is ``example.com`` rename it to your domain to get it working

Best practices for production
=============================
We suggest to use ``uwsgi/gunicorn`` + ``NGINX``.

`UWSGI documentation`_

Instalation::

    # nginx is optional
    # sudo apt-get install uwsgi uwsgi-plugin-python nginx

To enable ``uwsgi`` copy ``/opt/CAPE/uwsgi/cape.ini`` to ``/etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/cape.ini``:

.. code-block:: python

    [uwsgi]
    lazy-apps = True
    vacuum = True
    ; if using with NGINX
    ;http-socket = 127.0.0.1:8000
    ; if standalone
    http-socket = 0.0.0.0:8000
    static-map = /static=/opt/CAPEv2/web/static
    plugins = python38
    callable = application
    chdir = /opt/CAPEv2/web
    file = web/wsgi.py
    env = DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=web.settings
    uid = cape
    gid = cape
    enable-threads = true
    master = true
    processes = 10
    workers = 10
    ;max-requests = 300
    manage-script-name = true
    ;disable-logging = True
    listen = 2056
    ;harakiri = 30
    hunder-lock = True
    #max-worker-lifetime = 30
    ;Some files found in this directory are processed by uWSGI init.d script as
    ;uWSGI configuration files.


.. _`UWSGI documentation`: https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Start uwsgi with::

    $ systemctl restart uwsgi

    [Definition]
    failregex = ^<HOST> -.*"(GET|POST|HEAD) /api/.*HTTP.*"

    maxretry = 3
    findtime = 60
    bantime = -1
    # Remove cloudflare line if you don't use it
    action = iptables-multiport
             cloudflare

    # This will ban any host that trying to access kinda bruteforce login or unauthorized requests for 5 times in 1 minute
    # Goes to /etc/fail2ban/filters.d/filter.d/nginx-cape-login.conf
    [Definition]
    failregex = ^<HOST> -.*"(GET|POST|HEAD) /accounts/login/\?next=.*HTTP.*"

* To check banned hosts::

    $ sudo fail2ban-client status cape-api
